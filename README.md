# Parking Lot
    # I have written unit test case for all my functions available in my server.js file those who provides some logic.
    # Every function in server.js is created by meaninful names and also I have provided the description of fucntinality at every function. Also, if something was missing from your documentation and I suppose to take some decision on it, that also you cand find in function description.

# How to run?
    # bash bin/setup (It will install all the dependecies and will run all the unit test cases
    # bash bin/parking_lot (It will run all the commands available in '/functional_spec/fixtures/file_input.txt' and will give you the expected output in console)

# If you run your script?
    That is also running flawlessly.
        cd functional_spec 
        bundle exec rake spec:functional

# Open for Extension and modification
    I am ready to extend this project and modify it if somewhere I have missed anyhting.
    Thanks :)
